Azure Discovery
===============

Crate has native discovery support when running a cluster on Microsoft Azure
infrastructure. Since Azure does not support multicast, the discovery mechanism
uses the ARM (Azure Resource Management) mode APIs to generate the list of hosts
for the unicast host discovery.

The discovery mechanism is implemented as a plugin and resides within the plugin
folder of the Crate installation. However, since the Azure Java SDKs does have
a lot of dependencies and we want to keep the plugin jar small in size the
dependencies are not included in the Crate distribution.

Requirements
------------

To make the plugin work you have to add the following Java libraries to the
``$CRATE_HOME/plugins/crate-azure-discovery`` folder::

    - adal4j-1.0.0.jar
    - azure-core-0.9.3.jar
    - azure-keyvault-core-0.8.0.jar
    - azure-mgmt-compute-0.9.3.jar
    - azure-mgmt-network-0.9.3.jar
    - azure-mgmt-resources-0.9.3.jar
    - azure-mgmt-storage-0.9.3.jar
    - azure-mgmt-utility-0.9.3.jar
    - azure-storage-4.3.0.jar
    - bcprov-jdk15on-1.51.jar
    - commons-io-2.4.jar
    - commons-lang-2.6.jar
    - commons-lang3-3.3.2.jar
    - gson-2.2.4.jar
    - jackson-core-asl-1.9.13.jar
    - jackson-jaxrs-1.9.2.jar
    - jackson-mapper-asl-1.9.13.jar
    - jackson-xc-1.9.2.jar
    - javax.inject-1.jar
    - jaxb-api-2.2.2.jar
    - jaxb-impl-2.2.3-1.jar
    - jcip-annotations-1.0.jar
    - jersey-client-1.13.jar
    - jersey-core-1.13.jar
    - jersey-json-1.13.jar
    - jettison-1.1.jar
    - json-smart-1.1.1.jar
    - lang-tag-1.4.jar
    - nimbus-jose-jwt-3.1.2.jar
    - oauth2-oidc-sdk-4.5.jar

Basic Configuration
-------------------

To enable Azure discovery simply change the ``discovery.type`` setting to
``azure``::

    discovery.type: azure

The discovery mechanism can discover Crate instances within the same **vnet**
or the same **subnet** of the same **resource group**. By default it will the
**vnet**.

You can change the behaviour using the ``discovery.azure.method`` setting::

    discovery.azure.method: subnet

The used resource group also needs to be provided::

    cloud.azure.management.resourcegroup.name: production

Authentication
--------------

The discovery plugin requires authentication as service principle.
To do so, you have to create an ``Active Directory`` application with a password.
We recommened to follow the `AD Application Guide`_ .

The configuration settings for authentication are as follows::

    cloud.azure.management:
      subscription.id: my-id
      tenant.id: my-tenant
      app:
        id: my-app
        secret: my-secret

For a complete list of settings please refer to :ref:`conf_azure_discovery`.
